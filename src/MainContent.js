As HTML (before HTML5) is based on SGML,[4] its parsing also depends on the DTD, specifically an HTML DTD (e.g. HTML 4.01[5][note 4]). The DTD specifies which element types are possible (i.e. it defines the set of element types) and also the valid combinations in which they may appear in a document. It is part of general SGML behavior that, where only one valid structure is possible (per the DTD), its explicit statement in any given document is not generally required. As a simple example, the</p>
